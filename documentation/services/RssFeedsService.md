| [control_rss_feed](#control_rss_feed)     | ### Overview Controls an RSS Feed. By sending the RSS feed's ID and the type of operation you want to perform, it will perform said action on the RSS feed checker. Operations are either: - **Update** `forces an update on the rss feed` - **Delete** `deletes the rss feed from your account permanently. This also deletes all associated RSS feed items. This does not remove queued items spawned from the RSS feed.` - **Pause** `pauses checking the rss feed on the scan interval` - **Resume** `resumes a paused rss feed` ### Authorization Requires an API key using the Authorization Bearer Header.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
